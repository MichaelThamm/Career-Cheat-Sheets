Working closely with the FBI, CISA, DOJ and UK NCSC, WatchGuard investigated and developed a remediation for Cyclops Blink, a sophisticated state-sponsored botnet that may have affected a limited number (estimated at ~1%) of WatchGuard firewall appliances. WatchGuard has concluded, based on our own investigation, an investigation conducted jointly with Mandiant, and information provided by the FBI, that there is no evidence of data exfiltration from WatchGuard or its customers, and firewall appliances are not at risk if they were never configured to allow unrestricted management access from the Internet. Below we provide an overview of what happened and steps we recommend you take now to eliminate the threat posed by malicious activity from the botnet.

# What You Should Do

In response to this sophisticated, state-sponsored attack, WatchGuard has developed and released a set of simple and easy-to-implement Cyclops Blink detection tools, as well as a 4-Step Cyclops Blink Diagnosis and Remediation Plan to help customers diagnose, remediate if necessary, and prevent future infection. WatchGuard, supported by the FBI, CISA, NSA and UK NCSC, strongly recommends that all WatchGuard customers promptly take the actions outlined in the 4-Step Cyclops Blink Diagnosis and Remediation Plan to eliminate the threat posed by malicious activity from the botnet.
